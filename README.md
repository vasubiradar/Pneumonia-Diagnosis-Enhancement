# Pneumonia Diagnosis Enhancement

Welcome to the Pneumonia Diagnosis Enhancement project! This project leverages deep learning techniques to develop an advanced pneumonia diagnosis system using chest X-ray images. It aims to improve early detection and classification of pneumonia in pediatric patients.

## Project Overview

The Pneumonia Diagnosis Enhancement project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze chest X-ray images and classify them into pneumonia or normal categories. The system involves image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to achieve accurate diagnosis.

## Features

-Image Preprocessing: Normalize and augment chest X-ray images.
-Model Training: Build and train a CNN model for pneumonia detection.
-Evaluation: Assess model performance and accuracy.
-Visualization: Display results with graphical representations.
